# The Perfect Bite
## Food Decision and Recomendation platform

### Problem Statement
Couples, individuals, and families often waste time deciding what to eat due to constant decision fatigue, choice overload, and differences in taste. Existing applications that attempt to solve this problem heavily rely on text-based search and large result lists, requiring users to articulate preferences upfront and browse options manually. 

The Perfect Bite reframes food selection as a decision-support experience rather than a search problem. By learning user preferences and providing high confidence, image-based options, the platform reduces cognitive load and supports faster individual and collaborative decision-making.

### MVP Features
* User account creation and authentication 
* Preference configuration (dietary restrictions, cuisines, budget, distance)
* Create/join a shared session for collaborative decisions (invite code)
* Generation of personalized recommendation deck for individual user or a session
* Like/dislike actions persisted (stored server-side to prevent repeat options and enable matches) for individual or session participants; mutual likes within a session produce matches
* Final “pick” selection from matches (sessions) or from favorites/options (individual)
